### Learn math through balance and movement.

Overview
Balance Board Math (BBM) aims to foster new forms of inclusive math pedagogy by incorporating learnerâ€™s experiences of balance. Learners rock on a wooden balance board to explore a range of mathematical concepts including functions, negative numbers and absolute value.

Project team: Sofia Tancredi, Helen Li, Julia Wang, Carissa Yao, Genna Macfarlan, Cecelia Liu, Johnny Serrano, Kimiko Ryokai.

This project was built with the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE, Adafruit BNO055 Absolute Orientation Sensor, standard web technologies ( HTML, CSS & Javascript ) and p5.js.
